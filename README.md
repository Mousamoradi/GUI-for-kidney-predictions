## Advantages of GUI-based kidney predictions:
1- Can be used for real-time clinical applications.
2- No need to launch standalone python-based apps (e.g. Spider, Anaconda, ...)
3- Can be linked to MATLAB if data collection was done in MATLAB. 
4- Real-time image processing by intracting with user to set optimum values. 
## Required libraries and Modules:
1- Python>=3.8

2- PyQt5

3- matplotlib

4- Python openCV

5- Sklearn and Scikitimage

6- Tensorflow >= 2.4

7- Patchify
