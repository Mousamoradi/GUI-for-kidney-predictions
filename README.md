# GUI-for-kidney-predictions
This Graphical User Interface provides automated proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) lumen segmentation and make predictions for density and diameter of the detected PCTs.
## Advantages of GUI-based kidney predictions:
1- Can be used for real-time clinical applications.
2- No need to launch standalone python-based apps (e.g. Spider, Anaconda, ...)
3- Can be linked to MATLAB if data collection was done in MATLAB. 
4- Real-time image processing by intracting with user to set optimum values.
